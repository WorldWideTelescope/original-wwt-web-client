# The ORIGINAL AAS WorldWide Telescope Web Client

This repository archives the original Git history of the
[wwt-web-client](https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/wwt-web-client/)
repository. The current repository by that name has been split to contain only
the web app, while the underlying engine SDK now lives
[wwt-webgl-engine](https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/wwt-webgl-engine/).

The original history contained large generated files that made it expensive to
download. The history for the split repositories was derived from this
history, so there should be no loss of information, but just in case, the
original history is preserved here.
